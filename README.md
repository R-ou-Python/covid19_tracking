# covid19_tracking
Scrapers for daily tracking of COVID-19 reported cases in Massachusetts and New York for covidtracking.com project. Code will be embedded in an R Markdown document for use elsewhere so others on the project can go to a single URL and get generated data on demand (instead of a cron job).

Note that the formats of these pages may change -- the Massachusetts page especially has changed multiple times recently -- so the scrapers may break even though they worked at the time I created them.

If you use this code, _please don't run these scrapers more than a couple of times a day._ We are in the midst of a public health emergency, and I wouldn't want to contribute to others who need to access these sites being unable to get to them. Thanks. My cron jobs only scrape each site once a day.
